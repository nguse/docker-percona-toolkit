This Dockerfile will setup percona:latest and then install Percona Toolkit.  

Primary purpose for this was to parse Percona logs using pt-query-digest in a safe location away from any existing servers.  

More information on Percona Toolkit can be found at: https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/2.2/index.html
